<h1>The Best Movies According to Michelle</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Queen of the Damned</h3>
<p>Vampire movies are my favourite movies of all time. Not only is this the best vampire movie to exsist
    but it also comes across as a love story with amazing music.</p>

<h3>Tarot</h3>
<p>It's all about them horror movies! Probably the best recent horror movie I've seen in a really long time.</p>

<h3>10 Things I Hate About You</h3>
<p>The title says it all. A beautifully romantic movie that never ages.</p>
